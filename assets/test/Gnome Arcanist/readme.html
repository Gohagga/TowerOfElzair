<h2>Description</h2>
<p>My entry for the current Modelling Contest.<br />
<br />
<blockquote>For clarity, the &quot;Morph&quot; animation is an all-purpose transformation, while <i><span style="text-decoration: underline">Spell Gold/Lumber Alternate</span></i> were meant to be used with triggers as individual transformations for their respective forms. Considering the way animation tags work, both forms have a Morph animation, allowing the Arcanist to transform back into his base state without the same triggering hassle as it would take to get INTO those forms.</blockquote>Feel free to use and/or edit this model, so long as you credit me.<br />
<br />
EDIT:<br />
Spell effects are more varied now.<br />
